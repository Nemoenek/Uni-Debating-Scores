# Uni-Debating-Scores
Testing for use as Score DB

This Repo is intended to be used as a convenient database for keeping track of Debating Scores
Files corresponding to the recorded scores, topics and teams can be viewed by anyone.

Updating the score can be done by anyone, but using Github allows for changes to the database to be
vetted and recorded.
